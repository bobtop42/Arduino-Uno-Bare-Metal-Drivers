# Arduino-Uno-Bare-Metal-Drivers
Arduino Uno TWI, PWM pin interpetation, and (maybe) more drivers to come. This initial upload is from a 4 hour programming driver production day. I made these thinking I was going to use them for a different repo but did not need them. These drivers are for an Arduino Uno and emulate the functionality Linux to provide a seamless transiion for read/write over I2C fon Linux based drivers, so you can practically copy and paste them over to Arduino without having to have (too) much more of a headache when you already probably have if you have a Linux driver and now are using it on Arduino Defineatly cannot relate to having this problem. This was my first time ever touching an Arduino so I hope these will work, because I have not tested them too much.
